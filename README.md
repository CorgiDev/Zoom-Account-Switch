# Zoom-Account-Switch
Application allowing the user to easily switch between Zoom accounts.

## Required Modules

Make sure you have Python installed. I created this using Python 3.9.5 and pip version 21.1.2, but older versions may still work. The following additional Python modules need to be installed.

- pandas
- pyautogui

### Installing Modules

Module installation can be accomplished using the following command:

`python -m pip install <modulename>`

This does require that you have *pip* installed as well. For details on how to install pip, check out the official [pip documentation Installation page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
